# Admin Dashboard

This project is part of the The Odin Project curriculum.
It consist of using what we learned during the Intermediate HTML & CSS module to do an admin dashboard based on a design given by TOP.
For this project, I was inspired by the game Arknight: Endfield.

A [Live Demo](https://sephydev.github.io/admin-dashboard/) is available.

## What was the most easy part ?

The most easy part was doing the basic HTML skeleton for the project and the general layout with grid.

## What was the hardest part ?

The hardest part was alignment with the different section of the project.
I've got a lot of problems with grid on this project, and I tried my best to solve them. It is possible some problems are not fixed.
For the problems I've solved, I tried playing with space between the elements, with gap and padding.
